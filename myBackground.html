<p style="font-size: 20px; background-color:#0099FF; font-family:Helvetica;">I am Oyama  Siphula ,I was Born in 1993 on the 12th day of December. I was born and brought in Paarl Hospital by a lady called ''Minki'' then Xoleka Siphula was my mother's real name given by Gloria Siphula. I’m currently living in Paarl ,Mbekweni in Chris Hani location. I have only one brother Onke Siphula (2002) it is now 12 of age. I’m interested in mostly in Tech but also with some educational knowledge in order for me to monuever.</p>
<h2 h2 style="color: green;fint- sive:">My story</h2>

<p style="font-size: 20px; background-color:#FF6633; font-family:Helvetica;">I started schooling in 1995 at Inomzamo pre school and I graduated in 1999 preparing for that next coming year for Primary School. I began my Primary school in 2000 at Imboniselo when I was 7 years old of age perhaps other children were going to school when they are 6 years of age and at some point I thought I was old enough to be starting school,but panics was never an option that would've helped I end up rolling till I got done with my lower grades. At that stage I was only left with my grandma (T.G Siphula) ,Because my mother passed away,leaving me and my brother(Onke) with behind with only one person who was in-charge for us, since then I learnt a lesson that it is not worth to rely on another person because of this death that is proud and that it's my(your) responsibility  to live life to its best just for the sake of a better tomorrow(Future).</p>
 
 <h2 h2 style="color: green;fint- sive:">My Ambition</h2>

<p style="font-size: 20px; background-color:#00cd99; font-family:Helvetica;" >I never thought I would ask myself a lot of questions and answer them without consulting anyone when there was a need. When I was doing grade 9 things were seem to more complicated than before and by the way I was wishing to be one of South African popular DJ’s that would bring the real world to people  who like music as the time went on,my grandmother bought me a computer for me in order to not struggle with my CAT(Computer Application Technology) Study and just in case if would need something else that I would value it in terms of my career. I experienced lot of problems with it by curiosity. I liked to very much to experiment things assuming that everything will be easy. I once met a guy known as Chris the guy was from outside the boarder. Chris helped me a lot about Technological stuff more special with computer hardware and software. He extremely inspired me hence he told me that the more I'm experiencing problems, I would gain more knowledge but by working those problem out.</p>
